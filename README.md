# Igloo

Igloo Engine is a modular C++ custom game engine built with support for both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 rendering backends.
It features a custom math library, UI system, input handling, and integrated audio support via FMOD.
The engine can load image assets (via stb) and parse structured data using TinyXML2, enabling configurable gameplay and UI behaviors.
